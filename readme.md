***Anyone is allowed to help commit to the repo! Just make a [fork](https://github.com/ContinentalMC/CMC-Resource-Pack/fork) and then a [pull request](https://github.com/ContinentalMC/Movecraft-Types/compare) to help!***

<sup>Basic YAML skills are required! *Though it's very simple to learn!*</sup>



For craft config values, please look [here](https://github.com/APDevTeam/Movecraft/wiki/Example-Craft-File)

In addition, you can also use the snippet below to set maximum cannons allowed on a craft:

```Yaml
maxCannons:
    {cannontype}: N{# allowed on craft}
```
